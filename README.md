For you to run this magento locally you need to setup openlitespeed docker on your machine with the link bellow.
https://hub.docker.com/r/litespeedtech/openlitespeed

After installation of docker and docker-compose on your machine you can run the file docker-compose.yml in the folder instead of running the one in the ols folder that you will download or clone
you can clone the magento code to your machine and run to view the app on your machine.
